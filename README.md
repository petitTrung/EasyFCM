# Usage

## Message

If your want to listen messages from your Activity, there are 3 ways : 

* [MainActivity](https://github.com/trung-nguyen/EasyFCM/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/trung/easyfcm/MainActivity.java)
 
By registering your device to GCM server
  
```java
//call this onCreate() or onResume()
FCMManager.getInstance(this).registerListener(this);
  
//call this onDestroy()
FCMManager.getInstance(this).unRegisterListener();
```


Implement the interface `FCMListener`
```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity implements FCMListener{

  @Override
  public void onDeviceRegisted(String token) {
  
  }

  @Override
  public void onMessage(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {
  
  }

  @Override
  public void onPlayServiceError() {
  
  }
}
```

* [SampleActivity](https://github.com/trung-nguyen/EasyFCM/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/trung/easyfcm/SampleActivity.java)

By extending your `Activity` to [FCMActivity](https://github.com/trung-nguyen/EasyFCM/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/trung/fcm/library/FCMActivity.java)

* [SampleCompatActivity]

By extending your your `Activity` to [FCMCompatActivity](https://github.com/trung-nguyen/EasyFCM/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/trung/fcm/library/FCMCompatActivity.java)

## Topic

Subscription and Un-subscription to/from Topics. (after onDeviceRegistered())
```java

FCMManager.getInstance(this).unSubscribeTopic("topic");

```
